# The Poetry of Priority: A Philosophy of Auto-Pass and Phase Navigation

## The Core Problem: The Burden of Priority

In Magic: The Gathering, every player receives priority at every step of every turn. In a 4-player Commander game, this means **hundreds of priority passes per game cycle**. Most of these passes are meaningless - a player with only lands and sorceries in hand doesn't need to be asked if they want to respond during an opponent's upkeep.

Yet the rules demand it. The game cannot proceed without each player acknowledging they pass priority. This creates a paradox:
- **Strict adherence to rules** = Tedious gameplay, constant clicking
- **Skipping unnecessary prompts** = Risk of missing important moments

The auto-pass system is the bridge between these extremes.

## The Three Pillars of Priority Management

### 1. **canAct**: What Can You Do?

`canAct` asks the fundamental question: **"Do you have any legal actions available?"**

For the **active player (on their turn)**:
- Can you play a land? (Have lands in hand, haven't played max this turn, in main phase)
- Can you cast a sorcery-speed spell? (Main phase, stack empty)
- Can you cast an instant-speed spell? (Have mana, have instant/flash spells)
- Can you activate abilities? (Have mana, have activated abilities)

For **non-active players (opponent's turn)**:
- Only checks instant-speed actions (instants, flash, activated abilities)
- Sorcery-speed spells don't matter - you can't cast them anyway

**Philosophy**: Don't waste the player's time if they literally cannot do anything. If `canAct` returns false, auto-pass can safely skip this priority window.

### 2. **canRespond**: What Can You React With?

`canRespond` is narrower than `canAct` - it only checks **instant-speed responses**:
- Can you cast an instant or flash spell?
- Can you activate an instant-speed ability?
- Can you interact with the stack right now?

**Philosophy**: During an opponent's turn, or when the stack has items, you only care about instant-speed interaction. `canRespond` filters out the noise of lands and sorceries that are irrelevant in these moments.

**Key Distinction**:
- `canAct` = "Everything you could do at sorcery or instant speed"
- `canRespond` = "Only what you can do right now at instant speed"

### 3. **autoPassLoop**: The Automatic Skipper

`autoPassLoop` is the engine that chains together auto-passes:
1. Check if current player has auto-pass enabled
2. Check if they can act (`canAct` or `canRespond`)
3. If not, auto-pass them
4. Advance to next player
5. Repeat until finding a player who can act OR all players passed

**Original Behavior** (BEFORE the fix):
```
User clicks "Pass Priority" 
  → autoPassLoop runs
  → Auto-passes everyone who can't act
  → All players passed → Advance step → Skip to END
```

**Fixed Behavior** (AFTER the fix):
```
User clicks "Pass Priority"
  → Priority advances to next player
  → That player manually decides to pass or act
  → No aggressive auto-pass chain
  → Step only advances when ALL players manually pass
```

**Philosophy**: `autoPassLoop` should help players skip meaningless priority windows, but it should NOT make decisions for them when they explicitly take an action (clicking "Pass Priority").

## The Phase Navigator: Streamlining Empty Turns

The **Phase Navigator** was originally designed to solve a specific problem:
> "What if I have no more valid moves this turn? Do I need to pass priority 20+ times to end my turn?"

**Original Purpose**: When a player has exhausted their actions (played their land, cast their spells, etc.), the Phase Navigator lets them **fast-forward through their remaining turn** without manually passing priority at every step.

### How It Works

When you click "Next Step" or "End Turn" on the Phase Navigator:
- Game calls `nextStep()` or advances to cleanup directly
- Skips ALL priority passes in current step
- Moves to the next step or end of turn
- Gives you priority at the new step (if applicable)

### Use Cases

**Scenario 1: I'm Done With My Turn**
```
Main Phase 1:
  → Played my land
  → Cast all my spells
  → No more mana left
  → Click "End Turn" on Phase Navigator
  → Skip through: Combat → Main 2 → End → Cleanup
```

**Scenario 2: I Want to Skip to Combat**
```
Main Phase 1:
  → I have no sorceries to cast
  → I want to attack
  → Click "Begin Combat" on Phase Navigator
  → Skip directly to combat phase
```

**Scenario 3: I'm Stuck in Upkeep**
```
Upkeep:
  → Trigger resolves
  → I have no instant-speed responses
  → Click "Next Step" 
  → Skip to Draw step
```

### Key Distinction from "Pass Priority"

| Action | What It Does | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Pass Priority** | Pass once, give next player a chance | You're done for this moment, but others might respond |
| **Next Step** (Navigator) | Skip entire step, move forward | You know you're done with this step entirely |
| **End Turn** (Navigator) | Skip all remaining steps in turn | You have no more moves this turn |

**Philosophy**: The Phase Navigator is the "I'm done, let's move on" button. It's not about skipping one priority pass - it's about skipping an entire section of the turn when you know there's nothing left for you to do.

### Why This Matters

Without the Phase Navigator, a player who tapped out in Main 1 would need to:
1. Pass priority in Main 1 (3+ times around the table)
2. Pass priority at Begin Combat (3+ times)
3. Pass priority at Declare Attackers (3+ times)
4. Pass priority at Declare Blockers (3+ times)
5. Pass priority at Combat Damage (3+ times)
6. Pass priority at End Combat (3+ times)
7. Pass priority in Main 2 (3+ times)
8. Pass priority at End Step (3+ times)

That's **24+ priority passes** just to end a turn where you have no more actions!

The Phase Navigator collapses this to **one click**: "End Turn"

## Auto-Pass vs Phase Navigator: The Difference

Both systems help skip unnecessary priority passes, but they serve different purposes:

### Auto-Pass
- **Automatic**: No player input needed
- **Intelligent**: Only skips when `canAct/canRespond` returns false
- **Conservative**: Only skips YOUR priority windows
- **Scope**: One priority pass at a time

### Phase Navigator  
- **Manual**: Requires player to click "Next Step" or "End Turn"
- **Declarative**: "I'm done with this section"
- **Aggressive**: Skips all remaining priority passes in step/turn
- **Scope**: Entire step or rest of turn

**Analogy**:
- **Auto-pass** = The game being smart and not asking unnecessary questions
- **Phase Navigator** = You telling the game "I know what I want, skip ahead"

---

## The Priority Modal: The Choice

When auto-pass is disabled OR you can act, the **Priority Modal** appears:
- **"Take Action"** = I want to do something (claim priority)
- **"Pass Priority"** = I have nothing to do (pass once)

**Philosophy**: This modal is the game asking: "Do you want to do something?" It only appears when there's a meaningful choice.

## The Dance of Priority

Imagine a 4-player game:
1. **Alice's turn, Upkeep**
   - Alice has priority
   - `canAct` checks: Alice has no actions (lands only, not main phase)
   - Auto-pass skips Alice → Bob gets priority

2. **Bob (opponent) has priority**
   - `canRespond` checks: Bob has no instant-speed responses
   - Auto-pass skips Bob → Carol gets priority

3. **Carol (opponent) has priority**
   - `canRespond` checks: Carol has Counterspell in hand!
   - `canRespond` = true → Auto-pass STOPS
   - Carol gets the Priority Modal

4. **Carol clicks "Pass Priority"**
   - Carol manually passed
   - Priority advances to Dave
   - Dave gets a chance to respond

5. **Dave has priority**
   - `canRespond` checks: Dave has no responses
   - Auto-pass skips Dave → Back to Alice

6. **All players passed**
   - Priority cycles back to Alice
   - Alice already passed
   - ALL players passed once → Advance to next step (Draw)

---

## The Bug We Fixed

**The Problem**:
- User clicked "Pass Priority" during Upkeep
- `autoPassLoop` ran and auto-passed EVERYONE
- All players marked as "passed" → Step advanced immediately
- Game skipped from Upkeep → Draw → Main → Combat → End

**The Root Cause**:
- After a manual pass, `autoPassLoop` was called
- It saw "All players have auto-pass enabled and can't act"
- It auto-passed everyone in one chain
- This violated the principle: "Respect manual player actions"

**The Fix**:
- Removed `autoPassLoop` after manual priority passes
- Each player gets their turn to manually pass
- Step only advances when ALL players manually pass
- Auto-pass only applies when RECEIVING priority, not after passing

---

## Why This Matters

Magic is a game of **windows** - tiny moments where you can respond. The priority system is the game's heartbeat:

```
Beat 1: Upkeep (trigger window)
Beat 2: Draw (no priority)
Beat 3: Main Phase (sorcery speed window)
Beat 4: Combat (instant speed windows)
Beat 5: Main Phase (sorcery speed window)
Beat 6: End (trigger window)
```

Each "beat" has multiple priority passes (one per player, cycling). That's **30+ priority passes per turn** in a 4-player game.

**Auto-pass** makes the game playable by collapsing meaningless beats.
**canAct/canRespond** makes auto-pass intelligent by only skipping when safe.
**Phase Navigator** gives manual control when you know what you want.
**Priority Modal** gives choice when there's a meaningful decision.

Together, they create a system that is:
- **Fast** when nothing is happening
- **Precise** when timing matters
- **Respectful** of player agency
- **True** to the rules of Magic

---

## The Philosophical Core

The tension in designing this system is between:
- **Automation** (skip the boring parts)
- **Control** (don't skip important moments)

The solution is **contextual awareness**:
- "Can this player act?" (canAct)
- "Can this player respond?" (canRespond)
- "Do they want auto-pass?" (auto-pass setting)
- "Did they manually intervene?" (claiming priority, passing manually)

When these four questions are asked at the right moments, the game becomes fluid. Priority passes fade into the background, appearing only when they matter.

That's the poetry: **Invisible when unnecessary, visible when crucial.**

---

## For Developers: The Contract

When working with priority systems, remember:

1. **canAct** = Comprehensive check (sorcery + instant speed)
2. **canRespond** = Narrow check (instant speed only)
3. **autoPassLoop** = Automatic skipper (use sparingly)
4. **Manual actions** = Sacred (never override with auto-pass)
5. **Phase Navigator** = Player override (always respect)

The priority system is not just code - it's a **user experience philosophy**. Every decision about when to prompt and when to skip is a statement about what we value:
- Respecting the player's time
- Respecting the player's agency
- Respecting the rules of Magic

Get it right, and the game feels magical. Get it wrong, and it feels like clicking "OK" 1000 times.
